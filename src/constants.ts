Built from scratch with Next.js 14, NextAuth, TailwindCSS, Prisma (PostgreSQL), AWS S3, Zod, and Zustand, its architecture enables the management of products, orders, and differentiated roles. Three user types were defined: customers, who can add products to a wishlist, to the cart, and place orders; sellers, responsible for publishing and managing inventory; and administrators, overseeing category management and overall platform control. Although simplified compared to fully-fledged commercial solutions, this project emphasizes structure, scalability, and teamwork to build a more robust application",
